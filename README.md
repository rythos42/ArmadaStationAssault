# ArmadaStationAssault
Station Assault is a solo scenario for the board game Star Wars Armada. It's on GitHub because I got the original work from another person and I wanted to ensure it could be updated by others.


## Notes
The cards are created in Scribus, an open-source publishing program. 
paint.net is a good program for editing images in.

### Cards
* Size: 1.6142"  x 2.4803"
* With .25" bleed: 2.1142" x 2.9803"
* @ 300 dpi

In Adobe, print Mulitple on a Landscape sheet, in a grid 3 wide by 2 tall to get the correct size.

## Future Development
The original design had thought to use the station in co-op games or in the Corellian Conflict campaign. Players might be able to purchase them for systems and they would aid in combat there. In that case, the shipyards would repair friendly ships that come in range and the fuel tanks could give some other bonus.
